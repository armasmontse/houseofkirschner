    <p>House of Kirschner is an atelier that creates ephemera for luxurious 
    events. Driven by founder, Mauricio Kirschner’s expertise as an
    architect and interior designer, we stand apart from the competition. 
    Able to design and produce anything you could wish for, our unique 
    constructions, furniture and design-ware, go far beyond mere marquees 
    and flowers to celebrate the greatness of your happiness. <br><br><br>
    We deliver every dimension of magic anywhere on the map, no matter 
    how blissfully remote or fashionable your destination. From Tulum to 
    Boca Raton, St Barth’s to New York City—the team will meet your most 
    exacting demands with inspired perfection. <br><br><br>
    While working for the highest aesthetics of design, decor, cuisine and
    entertainment is what drives us, we never forget where each creation 
    starts: YOU. That means getting to know your personalities, dreams and 
    desires. The result is your own immersive universe that turns a special 
    celebration into exactly what it should be: <span class="regular">Original and unforgettable.</span></p>';
